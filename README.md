 # KNN_Movie_Recommend 
An application that uses KNN Classification to recommend movies based on user input.
Everything but the K-NN.py file is used to scrape an API, https://www.themoviedb.org/, to retrieve movie data. 
Some movie data is located on my local machine due to a movie repository I found on GitHub. 
K-NN is the executable file to input a movie and watch the program recommend films related to the user input.


Future Features:
- Implement UI
- More User Input (Search for movies to scrape, Info regarding the movie, Movie Poster)
- Add more features to KNN or even change the Model to a Decision Tree.
